## 0.29.2

### Notable Implementation Changes

- **Bug fix** (#4463): Making a subscription consumer actually stop
  running after encountering an exception (#4472, #4498). This bug
  is the **only** reason for the `0.29.2` release.
- Thread Changes
  - Added names to all threads created directly by Pub / Sub (#4474,
    #4476, #4480). Also removing spaces and colons from thread
    names (#4476).
- Logging changes
  - Adding debug logs when lease management exits (#4484)
  - Adding debug logs when `QueueCallbackThread` exits (#4494).
    Instances handle the processing of messages in a
    subscription (e.g. to `ack`).
  - Using a named logger in `publisher.batch.thread` (#4473)
  - Adding newlines before logging protobuf payloads (#4471)

## 0.29.1

### Notable Implementation Changes

- **Bug fix** (#4234): Adding retries for connection `UNAVAILABLE`. This
  bug made the Pub / Sub client mostly unusable for subscribers to topics
  that don't have a steady stream of messages. After ~2 minutes of inactivity,
  the gRPC connection would timeout and raise `UNAVAILABLE` locally, i.e. not
  due to a response from the backend. (#4444)
- Updating autogenerated packages (#4438)

### Documentation

- Fixing broken examples in quick start (#4398)
- Fixing broken example in README (#4402, h/t to @mehmetboraezer)
- Updating old/dead link to usage doc in README (#4406, h/t to @mehmetboraezer)

### Dependencies

- Dropping dependency on `google-cloud-core` in exchange for
  `google-api-core` (#4438)
