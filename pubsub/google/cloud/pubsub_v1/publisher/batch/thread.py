class Batch(base.BaseBatch):
    """A batch of messages.

    The batch is the internal group of messages which are either awaiting
    publication or currently in-flight.

    A batch is automatically created by the PublisherClient when the first
    message to be published is received; subsequent messages are added to
    that batch until the process of actual publishing _starts_.

    Once this occurs, any new messages sent to :meth:`publish` open a new
    batch.

    If you are using this library, you most likely do not need to instantiate
    batch objects directly; they will be created for you. If you want to
    change the actual batching settings, see the ``batching`` argument on
    :class:`~.pubsub_v1.PublisherClient`.

    Any properties or methods on this class which are not defined in
    :class:`~.pubsub_v1.publisher.batch.BaseBatch` should be considered
    implementation details.

    Args:
        client (~.pubsub_v1.PublisherClient): The publisher client used to
            create this batch.
        topic (str): The topic. The format for this is
            ``projects/{project}/topics/{topic}``.
        settings (~.pubsub_v1.types.BatchSettings): The settings for batch
            publishing. These should be considered immutable once the batch
            has been opened.
        autocommit (bool): Whether to autocommit the batch when the time
            has elapsed. Defaults to True unless ``settings.max_latency`` is
