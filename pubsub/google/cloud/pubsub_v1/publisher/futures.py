    This object is returned from asychronous Pub/Sub publishing calls, and is

    methods in this library.

    Args:
        completed (Optional[Any]): An event, with the same interface as
            :class:`threading.Event`. This is provided so that callers
            with different concurrency models (e.g. ``threading`` or
            ``multiprocessing``) can supply an event that is compatible
            with that model. The ``wait()`` and ``set()`` methods will be
            used. If this argument is not provided, then a new
            :class:`threading.Event` will be created and used.
