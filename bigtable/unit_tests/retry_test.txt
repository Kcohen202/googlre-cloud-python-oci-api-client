# This retry script is processed by the retry server and the client under test.
# Client tests should parse any command beginning with "CLIENT:", send the corresponding RPC
# to the retry server and expect a valid response.
# "EXPECT" commands indicate the call the server is expecting the client to send.
#
# The retry server has one table named "table" that should be used for testing.
# There are three types of commands supported:
# READ <comma-separated list of row ids to read>
#     Expect the corresponding rows to be returned with arbitrary values.
# SCAN <range>... <comma separated list of row ids to expect>
#     Ranges are expressed as an interval with either open or closed start and end,
#     such as [1,3) for "1,2" or (1, 3] for "2,3".
# WRITE <comma-separated list of row ids to write>
#     All writes should succeed eventually. Value payload is ignored.
# The server writes PASS or FAIL on a line by itself to STDOUT depending on the result of the test.
# All other server output should be ignored.
