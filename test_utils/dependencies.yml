# This file maintains a dependency chain for client libraries.
#
# Changes to any dependency should ensure that system tests for the
# downstream library also run.
#
# Core is assumed to be a dependency of everything and is not explicitly
# listed in this file.
#
# A library is considered a dependency of another if EITHER:
#   - It is included as a dependency in setup.py (true dependency).
#   - It is included as a dependency in nox.py for system tests
#     (system test dependency).
