Google Cloud Python Client
==========================

Python idiomatic clients for `Google Cloud Platform`_ services.

.. _Google Cloud Platform: https://cloud.google.com/


See a full list of published libraries at https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference.


Stability levels
*******************

The `development status classifier`_ on PyPI indicates the current stability
of a package. 

.. _development status classifier: https://pypi.org/classifiers/

General Availability
--------------------

**GA** (general availability) indicates that the client library for a
particular service is stable, and that the code surface will not change in
backwards-incompatible ways unless either absolutely necessary (e.g. because
of critical security issues) or with an extensive deprecation period.
Issues and requests against GA libraries are addressed with the highest
priority.

GA libraries have development status classifier ``Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable``.

.. note::

    Sub-components of GA libraries explicitly marked as beta in the
    import path (e.g. ``google.cloud.language_v1beta2``) should be considered
    to be beta.

Beta Support
------------

**Beta** indicates that the client library for a particular service is
mostly stable and is being prepared for release. Issues and requests
against beta libraries are addressed with a higher priority.

Beta libraries have development status classifier ``Development Status :: 4 - Beta``.

Alpha Support
-------------

**Alpha** indicates that the client library for a particular service is
still a work-in-progress and is more likely to get backwards-incompatible
updates. See `versioning`_ for more details.


Alpha libraries have development status classifier ``Development Status :: 3 - Alpha``.

If you need support for other Google APIs, check out the
`Google APIs Python Client library`_.

Example Applications
--------------------

-  `getting-started-python`_ - A sample and `tutorial`_ that demonstrates how to build a complete web application using Cloud Datastore, Cloud Storage, and Cloud Pub/Sub and deploy it to Google App Engine or Google Compute Engine.
-  `google-cloud-python-expenses-demo`_ - A sample expenses demo using Cloud Datastore and Cloud Storage

Authentication
--------------

With ``google-cloud-python`` we try to make authentication as painless as possible.
Check out the `Authentication section`_ in our documentation to learn more.
You may also find the `authentication document`_ shared by all the
``google-cloud-*`` libraries to be helpful.
